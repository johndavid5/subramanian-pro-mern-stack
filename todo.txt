1. Extra Credit: Implement your "Are you sure you wish to delete this..."
as a react-boostrap Modal rather than a javascript confirm()...

Shall we implement it ourselves, or use...
   https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-confirm-bootstrap
...?

2. Find a "log4js" to be used on the client side...
   console.log() is considered un-cool..
